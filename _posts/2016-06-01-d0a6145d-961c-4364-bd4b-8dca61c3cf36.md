Swid Family Day Care has been around for 30+ years. It was started by Rose-Marie Swid, who moved to California from Sweden in 1975\. Rose-Marie began her childcare business in 1981 right after Lisa was born. Lisa is now living in San Diego and following in her mother's footsteps by opening her own home childcare business.
