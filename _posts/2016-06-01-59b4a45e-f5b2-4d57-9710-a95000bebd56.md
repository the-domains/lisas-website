With her mother's guiding principles, Lisa offers the best "home away from home" for infants. Lisa knows the roller coaster of emotions that can happen when you leave your baby in someone else's care. She says she is still recovering from returning to work when her son was 3 months old as her dream had always been to be a stay-at-home mom. She wasn't able to stay home when her son was an infant but this business has allowed her to not give up on her dream of being home with babies!
