description: 'Swid Family Day Care has been around for 30+ years. It was started by Rose-Marie Swid, who moved to California from Sweden in 1975. Rose-Marie began her childcare business in 1981 right after Lisa was born. Lisa is now living in San Diego and following in her mother’s footsteps by opening her own home child care business. With the birth of Lisa’s son, Jonah, in 2011, she searched high and low for a place like her mom’s in San Diego. With the growing realization of how special her mom’s place was, and seeing and feeling a real need for quality in-home infant care in San Diego, she decided to quit her day job and open her own business in 2016. With her mother’s guiding principles, she seeks to offer the best “home away from home” for infants. Lisa knows the roller coaster of emotions that can happen when you leave your baby in someone else’s care. She says she is still recovering from returning to work after her son was born as her dream had always been to be a stay-at-home mom. She wasn’t able to stay home when her son was an infant but this business has allowed her to not give up on her dream of being home with babies! :) She takes pride in caring for babies during the day, but also making sure parents are cared for as well! Happy to answer any questions you might have and work with you to make sure it is a good fit.'
